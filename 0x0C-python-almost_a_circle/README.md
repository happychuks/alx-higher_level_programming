# Unit Testing

## Introduction

This document provides a guide on writing and running unit tests for the project using the `unittest` framework in Python.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed. If not, you can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Directory Structure
Organize your project directory to have a clear separation of source code and test code. A common structure is:
```
project/
├── src/
│   └── your_code.py
└── tests/
    └── test_your_code.py
```

## Writing Unit Tests
1. Test File Naming
   Name your test files with a prefix test_, and keep them in the tests directory.

2. Test Class and Methods
   - Create a test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
   - Define test methods within the class, ensuring their names start with `test_`.
Examples:
```python
import unittest
from your_code import YourClass

class TestYourCode(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_method_one(self):
        # Your test logic here
        self.assertEqual(YourClass.method_one(), expected_result)
```

3. Assertions: Use various assertions provided by unittest such as `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, `assertRaises`, etc.

4. Setup and Teardown: If needed, use `setUp` and `tearDown` methods to set up and clean up resources used by multiple test methods.

## Running Unit Tests
1. Command Line: Run the tests from the command line using:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

2. Specific Test File:
To run a specific test file, use:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_your_code
```

3. Test Discovery: The `discover` command finds and runs all tests in the `tests` directory.

## Continuous Integration
Consider integrating unit tests into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure tests are run automatically on code changes.

Writing and maintaining unit tests is crucial for ensuring the reliability and correctness of your code. Regularly run tests during development to catch and fix issues early in the development process.
