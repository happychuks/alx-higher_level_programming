# Introduction to Python Lambda, Filter, Reduce, and Map
Lambda Functions:
In Python, a lambda function is a concise way to create anonymous functions, i.e., functions without a name. These functions are often used for short, one-time operations where a full function definition is unnecessary. Lambda functions are defined using the lambda keyword.

Filter:
Filter is a built-in Python function that, when combined with a lambda function, allows you to selectively include or exclude elements from a sequence (like a list or tuple). It returns a new sequence containing only the elements that satisfy a given condition.

Map:
Map is another built-in function in Python that, along with a lambda function, enables you to apply a specific operation to each element in a sequence (like a list or tuple). It creates a new iterable with the results of applying the provided function to each item in the original iterable.

Reduce:
The reduce function is part of the functools module in Python. It, too, is often used in conjunction with a lambda function. Unlike map and filter, reduce performs a cumulative binary operation on the elements of a sequence, reducing them to a single value. It continually applies the specified function to the elements, accumulating a result.

In summary, lambda functions provide a concise way to create small, anonymous functions. Filter allows for selective inclusion or exclusion of elements based on a condition. Map applies a function to each element in a sequence, producing a new iterable. Reduce performs a cumulative binary operation on the elements, reducing them to a single value. These functionalities are powerful tools in Python for functional programming and data manipulation.
